  <p>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Computer Science Teachers’ Association (CSTA) has selected four high school students from among a poolo f graduating high school seniors throughout the U.S. for the ACM/CSTA CutlerBell Prize in High School Computing. The winners included Maurice Korish of Livingston, a student at Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School in Livingston.

Eligible students applied for the award by submitting a project/artifact that engages modern technology and computer science. A panel of judges selected the recipients based on the ingenuity, complexity, relevancy, and originality of their projects.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>For the second year in a row, a team from RKYHS took home first place in the PitchNJ “Shark Tank” competition! The team of Rebecca Arian, Sophia Eisenberg and Mari Kaufman won for their innovative Biowrap, an environmentally friendly replacement for plastic for use in water bottles, agriculture and for medical purposes. The team of Naomi Klein, Ellie Minsky and Rebecca Dyckman were also finalists for Alerta, products that sense allergens in food and alert emergency contacts when a user is having an allergic reaction.

Students all over New Jersey submitted their work and a total of 15 teams were selected for the competition, with eight being named finalists. The RKYHS groups presented their inventions in a “Shark Tank” style in front of a panel of expert judges comprised of business and corporate leaders. Both teams’ devices are being prototyped in their scientific engineering course, part of of the four year RKYHS STEM sequence.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>RKYHS scientific engineering students entered submissions for the Pitch NJ youth entrepreneur and pitch competition. The submissions from students from all over New Jersey were reviewed by an esteemed panel, and only 10 finalist teams were selected—with three of them coming from RKYHS.

The three RKYHS finalist groups presented in a “Shark Tank” style in front of a panel of expert judges comprised of business and corporate leaders, including Ari Soroken CFO of BAI Brands who led Bai Brands through a 1.7 billion dollar acquisition by Dr Pepper, one of the largest acquisitions in NJ history. The evening also included a keynote speech from Mr. Soroken.


The team of Tommi Ratzker, Eli Novick and Rebecca Nussbaum took home first prize in the competition for the JDawg which senses Juuling in school bathrooms and notifies appropriate administrators. The team of Maurice Korish and Yisroel Newmark earned third place with the FeedBot that enables physically challenged people to feed themselves independently. The third team, Reuven Dersovitz, Eden Bendory and Lexi Berger presented their FaceCam product to identify intruders entering a school and notify administrators.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> RKYHS Students win 2nd place and Honorable Mention in PitchNJ! </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Spring is the season for pitch events, and Morris Tech Meetup started off in late March with Pitch New Jersey, a virtual event for students.

The event was sponsored by West Morris Capital (Lake Hopatcong), which provided the funding and prizes.  The first-place winner will appear on the Passage to Profit radio show, hosted by Richard and Elizabeth Gearhart on WOR 710 or iHeartRadio. Other sponsors included the Morris County Economic Development Corporation (Florham Park), Business BootCamp (Denville), iEnterprises (Chatham) and Fairleigh Dickinson University, where the group usually holds its meetings.

The top winner was Fetch by Maya, who also received $1,500. Fetch is a healthy dog treat company whose founder developed the formula for the treats and has sold some of them, giving a portion of her proceeds to charity. Maya, who will go by just her first name here because she is only in 6th grade, said the treats are gluten-free and use human-grade ingredients, among them almond flour, rolled oats mixed with coconut oil and spices, which make the treats smell good to humans. “They are naturally sweetened with bananas and have no allergens,” she told the group. The judges liked the fact that this very young competitor had already made money from her idea, and that she had incorporated a philanthropic component.

The second-place winner, claiming a prize of $1,000, was Security Key, represented by Azaryah Foger and Rebecca Wiater. The team uses fingerprint readers in a system for vetting authorized school entry and attendance keeping. They first developed the idea as a way to keep religious schools secure while still allowing authorized entry. And as the team noted, religious organizations don’t often have the money to hire security guards. The judges liked the novel suggestion that the fingerprint readers also tie into the institution’s attendance records, creating an easier way for the school administration to take attendance. The system can also be used for security at houses of worship.

Coming in third place, and winning $500, was Weasel, which presented a novel solution to the lack of security and anonymity in SMS. The team included Tejas Mehta, Connor McDermid, Mario DiSanza and Frank Gomes. The app, which is accompanied by a tiered subscription plan, allows SMS messages to be made private and undecipherable. There are also virtualized phone numbers for encrypted messaging use. During the event, several attendees commented on the technical knowledge and abilities of this team of high schoolers, who were able to put this prototype together.

Two of the student entrepreneurial groups won honorable mentions, receiving $250 each. They were Deliver Together and The Guardian.

Deliver Together had an inspiring story. The student-led nonprofit organization, run by Maurice Korish, Adam Hollander, Neil Mathew and Matthew Mendelsohn, was created after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It delivers groceries to immunocompromised and elderly individuals by pairing high school volunteers with clients. Their project covers several counties.

The Guardian team, made up of Ariel Hammerman, Liav Merlin and Alexis Sohnen, envisioned a watch app for Alzheimer patients that would allow their guardians to track their loved ones’ locations, pulse abnormalities, falls, general emergencies and wandering. And it provides the patients with cognitive exercises and personalized daily alarms to signify their completion. The team also aims to build a network for the caregivers of these patients to exchange tips and discuss concerns.</p>
